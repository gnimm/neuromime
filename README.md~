GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The “neuromime” is an electronic model of an organic nerve cell that can be interconnected in chains and loops. It is released here as an open-source hardware project in a collaborative effort by artists Norman White (original concept and design) and Peter Flemming (revision, expansion). Neuromimes are intended for (but not limited to) use in the creation of electro-physical artworks. Neuromimes can also function as the modular core of laboratory-style workshops where participants collectively generate an artwork for exhibition. Neuromimes are extensible building blocks, ideally suited to a collective making setting and/or generative, interactive artworks. Reminiscent of an exquisite corpse, they provide a framework that, while structured, is not scripted.

PROPERTIES OF AN ORGANIC NEURON

1. All-or-Nothing – It either fires completely or not at all (in this way it is "digital").

2. Temporal Summation – It can be made to fire by triggering one dendrite receptor repeatedly over time.

3. Spatial Summation – It can be made to fire by triggering several of its dendrite receptors simultaneously or virtually so.

4. Latency – It takes awhile for the impulse to travel from the dendrite receptor(s) along the axon to the output points (terminals).
5. Refractory Period – Once fired, it rests awhile before it can respond to stimuli again.
